### Contributing

- This is my first non-trivial project using Svelte and a few other technologies, if I'm using bad practices, I'll hear you out on the subject. However this is not a guarantee I will implement your suggestions.
- Not intended to be a pixel perfect replica of the UI, even if it is close; Complaints in this arena will likely be ignored.
- I will only accept contributions that fit the existing style and intention of the project.
- Code that is not formatted and linted will be rejected.
- I ask that you use a spell checker in vscode if you use vscode, but I'm a bit more lax on this subject. There are already settings for [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) in this repository.
