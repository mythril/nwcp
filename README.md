## Road-map

- Chosen One
  - Leveling up will be supported at some point
  - Consumable effects (Chems, books, etc)
  - Game play acquired perks / bonuses
  - Gear stats
  - Difficulty manipulation and other common exploits
- (Vault Dweller) Eventually plan to support Vault Dweller characters on the '/vault-dweller' Url path
- (Courier) Eventually plan to support Courier characters on the '/courier' Url path
- (Lone Wanderer) Eventually plan to support Lone Wanderer characters on the '/lone-wanderer' Url path
- Default path will have a game menu when there is a need for it
- (Sole Survivor) I do not see any reason to ever support Sole Survivor characters
- Minimal Accounts?
- Cloud saves?
- Linkable builds via cloud saves?
- Event sourced data store will be the method of storage. (Journaled events style)
