# Nuclear Wasteland Character Planner

## Road-map

- Chosen One
  - Leveling up will be supported at some point
  - Consumable effects (Chems, books, etc)
  - Game play acquired perks / bonuses
  - Gear stats
  - Difficulty manipulation and other common exploits
- (Vault Dweller) Eventually plan to support Vault Dweller characters on the '/vault-dweller' Url path
- (Courier) Eventually plan to support Courier characters on the '/courier' Url path
- (Lone Wanderer) Eventually plan to support Lone Wanderer characters on the '/lone-wanderer' Url path
- Default path will have a game menu when there is a need for it
- (Sole Survivor) I do not see any reason to ever support Sole Survivor characters
- Minimal Accounts?
- Cloud saves?
- Linkable builds via cloud saves?
- Event sourced data store will be the method of storage. (Journaled events style)

### Contributing

- This is my first non-trivial project using Svelte and a few other technologies, if I'm using bad practices, I'll hear you out on the subject. However this is not a guarantee I will implement your suggestions.
- Not intended to be a pixel perfect replica of the UI, even if it is close; Complaints in this arena will likely be ignored.
- I will only accept contributions that fit the existing style and intention of the project.
- Code that is not formatted and linted will be rejected.
- I ask that you use a spell checker in vscode if you use vscode, but I'm a bit more lax on this subject. There are already settings for [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) in this repository.
